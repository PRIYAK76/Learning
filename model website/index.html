            <h1>Tobias Becs: Soccer freestyler</h1>
            <h2 class="animate slide"> World champion </h2>
            <p>Tobias Becs is a world champion soccer freestyler based in Norway. His personal website
                 opens up into a fullscreen image of himself in action, accompanied by a brief snippet 
                 of text. This major homepage design trend is great for setting the stage, clearly defining
                  the topic and tone of the website from the get-go.</p>
            <p1>As a successful influencer and vlogger, Tobias is a good example of making the most of your 
                social media marketing. His website showcases three of his main social media channels in a grid
                 format. When hovering over each of them, visitors can see the large number of followers Tobias
                has on each platform, evidence of his creativity when it comes to content, second only to his
                 freestyling moves.</p1>
